# check-no-local-detail.sh — fail the build if local-system detail or proprietary-derived
# content reappears in a TRACKED file. The repo is public; this guard is the durable defense
# against re-introducing the categories that a one-time scrub removed.
#
# It flags (by PATTERN, so it never itself contains a real secret value):
#   - absolute home paths            (a local-system path leak)
#   - the local container-name shape (deployment-specific infrastructure detail)
#   - an inline DB password flag     (the `-u<user> -p<pass>` credential antipattern)
#   - references to a decompiled commercial client and RE tooling
#     (ghidra / capstone / the client exe / a `decompiled/` path / lifted `FUN_xxxxxx` symbols)
#
# Run locally with:  scripts/check-no-local-detail.sh
# Exit 0 = clean, exit 1 = a forbidden pattern was found (prints file:line).
#
# Adapted from the same guard in the eqoxide client repo (djhenry/eqoxide,
# scripts/check-no-local-detail.sh) — kept in sync by hand since the two repos are separate.
